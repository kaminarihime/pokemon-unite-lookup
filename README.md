# PokÃ©mon Unite Synergy & Counter Lookup

Welcome to my very first solo Python project! ðŸŽ‰

I love Pokemon Unite!

But I hate having to remember who counters what and with a short amount of time, websites load slow!

This handy little tool makes it super easy to discover which PokÃ©mon work well together and which ones to watch out for when youâ€™re playing PokÃ©mon Unite. Just type in a PokÃ©monâ€™s name, and instantly get info on top synergies and counters to help you plan your team or learn a new pick.

I built this because I love making gameplay smoother for everyone, and I hope it helps you jump into matches with more confidence and strategy!

## ðŸŒŸ How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
2. Download `lookup.py` and `pokemon_data.json` from this repo.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the script with: python3 lookup.py
5. Enter the name of a PokÃ©mon you want to look up.
6. Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™ll see which PokÃ©mon work well with your pick, who theyâ€™re strong against, and who counters them.

## Why I Made This

As a big PokÃ©mon Unite fan, I always wanted a quick way to check team comps and matchups. Building this project was my way of learning new coding skills *and* giving back to the community!

Feel free to use it, share it, or even suggest improvements. This is just the start! More features to come as I keep learning! ðŸš€

Thanks for checking out my project, and good luck on your Unite adventures!
